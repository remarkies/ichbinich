Digital Ideation - Mentoring Project

Goal of this project is to create a website, which displays paintings in an astethic way and offers the functionality to directly sell them. 
The website will contain a CMS for dynamically maintaining the content.

## Infrastructure




## Database
I chose to use MariaDB (a relational open-source database) because I want to have structured consistent data in the back end of my shop. Additionaly it's user-friendlier to inspect data in a relational database while the project is still in developement. I didn't chose MySQL or ORACLE because I already worked with both in the past but never with MariaDB.
